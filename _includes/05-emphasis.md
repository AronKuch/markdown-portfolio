My work experience has been varied. Certainly it has plenty of data analysis via **Excel** as well as occasional dips in **Access** which is where I first started picking up **SQL**. Around the time I was learning those, I was also dabbling in _HTML_ and _CSS_ to build webpages with backend support in _PHP_. Overtime other software like **Cognos** and languages like _JavaScript_ and **R** were added to my skill set. My work in _**Salesforce.com**_ has utilized both my analyics and my webpage skills.
